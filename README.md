# Watcher of Friends Online

Prints all of your online vk friends

## Usage

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:
* Install modules
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```
* Run script

```bash
$ python vk_friends_online.py
Login: xxx
Password: ***

=== Online friends: 3 ===
Some guy
Some girl
Best Friend
```
Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
